						Data Gathering Robot
					</h1>
					<p>I thought of creating an open source system for data gathering in a hazardous situation not fit
						for directly accessing by a human. It is
						inspired by all terrain robot Viper by Elbit and several other robots like rhex and sand flee by
						bostan dynamics </p>

					Suppose there is a major fire outbreak and after the fire outbreak the building is not safe to be
					entered becoz the iron bars melt and walls become weak so it has to be checked by the experts so
					that they can certify it to be safe. Now getting inside the building is not safe for the experts
					too, why not send a robot that could be controlled from outside,go in and send the video and images
					so that the team has the idea of the kind of damage and cracks and can further make a decision.
					Moreover the rover can also sense fumes and other toxic gas levels.As the weight of the rover will
					be lesser than the human weight it will further reduce the chances of collapsing the building.

					Can also be tweaked to gather data from radioactive ,industrial gas leakage situation or for any
					other situation where there are no sensors already installed.

					Further,There is a thought process behind creating any new thing a journey and a story of how you
					face hurdles and how you tackle them. In
					this post i will share about how i created the rakshak-1 system

				<h3>Hardware Integration</h3>
				The board numbered 1 is the first board on which i tested various motors . The IC used is L298 by
				STmicroelectronics. The board is a paper epoxy board designed on eagle and completely fabricated at
				home using the laser printer and hot iron method.
				Once i found it good i went for a more compact design that is numbered as 2 this is a glass epoxy
				board ,i ran two of my robots using this board.

				<div class="image main"><img src="images/integration.PNG" alt="" /></div>

				I wanted to make a shield(A shield is an arduino compatible pin configuration) so that the hardware
				can be neatly stacked on the arduino uno .I came across a motor driver on an online shop and i found
				the design to be very compact. After running the motors of Rakshak-1 on it i understood that it is a
				overuse of resources and space to go with big power diodes IN5408 for blocking the spikes produced
				by motors rather a IN4007 would suffice and would make the design compact.
				To make the system up and running i needed to have a hardware which can provide different voltages
				and can give enough power to drive the motors and power the sensors, micro-controller and other
				peripherals. Initially the GUI software is tested with the hardware arrangement numbered as 3. The
				shield was handwired and i have used a 11.1 v 1500mAh lithium ion battery to power the system. If
				you would look closely there are 4 resistors of quarter watt attached in parallel to drop the
				voltage from 11.1 to 9v This 9v is fed to the motors and 5v regulator provides power to arduino ,IC
				operations and LM35. Since i couldnot find a single resistor of high wattage adding 4 in parallel
				solved the wattage problem but still using resistors to drop voltage when current drawn is high is
				an inefficient method. Hence i decided to use a buck configuration in the next design of shield.
				A coil is an integral part of a buck circuitry,but soon i realised that finding a coil of particular
				value is a uphill task ,i searched on element14 and a few other places but an exact coil was very
				hard to find ,moreover the price of coil was almost of the same price as that of a buck convertor
				module that include an IC ,some capacitors LED. So i initially though i will buy a module will
				desolder the coil and use it on the board i will design but there was another thing that was going
				to put me in a tight spot and that was the board house. The board house that i had easy access to
				still follows manual processes so i couldn't route the wires too close,too thin, moreover i have to
				use the locally available through hole components because the SMD components are harder to find
				locally and the vender wouldn't make something available to you until you order in bulk. So finally
				the most practical solution was to buy the buck converter module and use it as a component. So i
				designed the pads where i can fix the module. The only SMD component that i used are the LM1117
				regulators which were not only small in size but can also provide current upto 800mA.
				After all this came the design number 4 , i had to add a component externally and it worked but i
				missed a few design consideration as i designed it in a hurry. In the next design no 5 i fixed those
				things and finally got something good .

				<h3>Temperature and Gas Sensor </h3>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/SENSOR.PNG" alt="" /></div>

				<h3>Software</h3>
				<p>
					The software on the onboard micro-controller turns on and turns off the geared DC motors ,headlights
					and set the position of servo motors depending upon the data received by the GUI. It also samples
					the temperature sensor and gas sensor data using its 10 bit successive approximation type ADC. It
					also measures the number of revolutions of motor by using a hardware setup which includes a hall
					effect sensor by allegro and a magnetic ring, the ring has 8 poles north and south places
					alternatively the ring is mounted on the output shaft of the motor when one of the two pole passes
					the output of the sensor turns high and when other one passes the output becomes low. These state
					changes are counted by the micro controller over a period of time using the interrupts and then are
					sent to the GUI to use this data to find out the RPM and distance by taking into account the
					Circumference of wheel. I have tried to keep the manipulation on the GUI side as the microcontroller
					is a low end 8 bit microcontroller working at just 16Mhz.
					The GUI software is written using open source processing development environment. This GUI software
					can run on MAC, Windows or Linux.
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/GUI.PNG" alt="" /></div>

				The current position of various elements on the GUI have come up after a number of iterations and
				after looking at the ease of user experience i found this placement to be most suitable.One
				challenge in creating the software was to manage the sending of commands and receiving of data. Xbee
				series 2 modules are used for transmitting and receiving the data and xbee are half duplex
				.Receiving the data and transmitting the commands in real time would require a full duplex system.
				So an approach is used where just for the short time while command is sent the channel is occupied
				,rest of the time the time the channel is free to receive the incoming data. The microcontroller is
				set to send the sensor data once every second . This way while we have slight delay of 1 sec while
				receiving the data the rover can be controlled instantaneously,so it is not that you will have to
				stop the rover to receive the sensor value ,the usercan keep on moving it and make it go wherever he
				wants and he will keep on receiving the data too. It is kind of parallel approach,may be in future
				versions things can be improved even more.

				<h3>3D Printing</h3>
				<p>There are several parts of the robot chasis which are manufactured using 3d printing. This section
					shows
					the process </p>
